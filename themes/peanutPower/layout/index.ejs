        <p class="dcf-txt-lg">I am an award-winning, multi-disciplined web designer/developer fluent in both E-learning
            and front-end web development. I love design and coding. On my spare time, I can often be found at code
            meetups and conferences, or hacking away at projects. I am constantly looking for ways to write better
            code and improve my skills.</p>
        <p class="dcf-txt-lg">This is a portfolio of projects I have worked on. Dig away.</p>
