project_type: Website redesign
client: Nebraska Early Development Network
brief_description: "The IFSP website provides self-paced tutorial on Individualized Family Service Plan aimed at social professionals and families around Nebraska. This was my first project of completely redesigning a website from ground up. The preexisting site was Flash-based and had to be converted into HTML as major evergreen browsers were dropping their Flash support at the time."

process: "<p>I completely redesigned the front-end using static HTML, CSS and JS while still keeping the PHP backend. I also improved the navigation and flow of the website based on UX best practices such as a clear content focus on each page, an intuitive, task-oriented Information Architecture and navigation bar, and a clear Call To Action on the homepage. </p>

<p>Key features:</p>
<ul><li>Wrote custom vanilla JavaScript code for the hamburger and search button toggle buttons that has different behavior on desktop and mobile.</li></ul>
