challenge: "As part of the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree, I was required to build a neighbourhood map single-page application using KnockoutJS MVC framework and information sourced from various APIs such as the Google Maps and Wikipedia APIs."
process: "Created a single-page responsive web application using the Bootstrap and Knockout MVC Framework. API calls are made to Google Maps and Wikipedia APIs. When the data is successfully returned, the map is created on the canvas with the location pins and the JSONP from Wikipedia is parsed and the info displayed to the user. Users can then search all included landmarks and, when selected, additional information about a landmark is displayed."
